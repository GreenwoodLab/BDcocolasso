R software package to implement sparse regression in high-dimensional setting, with a small portion of covariates corrupted (that is to say with additive error measure, or with missing data). This package implements simple CoCoLasso algorithm, and a variation called Block-Descent CoCoLasso, or BDCoCoLasso, for settings where only a small percentage of the features are corrupted.

This package is based on the [CoCoLasso algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07123.pdf). CoCoLASSO requires a computationally demanding positive semi-definite projection of the covariance matrix for a high dimensional feature set. In our context when there are corrupted and uncorrupted covariates, we take advantage of the block descent minimization trick to develop a more efficient algorithm. In an alternating block minimization algorithm, the CoCoLasso corrections are used when updating corrupted coefficient vectors, and a simple LASSO is used for the uncorrupted coefficient vectors. Both subproblems are convex and hence a global solution can be obtained, even though adaption of the cross-validation step requires care in this setting where there are products of corrupted and uncorrupted matrices.

## Installation



``` r
install.packages("BDcocolasso")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("celiaescribe/BDcocolasso")
```
## Vignette

See the online vignette for details about the BDcoco model and example usage of the functions.

## Model input

There exist two settings in which the BD-CoCoLasso can be used : in the simple CoCoLasso version, and in the Block-Descent-CoCoLasso version. The inputs vary according to the chosen setting, and according to the chosen noise setting.

* CoCoLasso setting
This method requires six inputs (let n be the number of observations and p the number of X variables):
1. **X** n x p matrix of covariates. Can be high-dimensional, i.e., p >> n. Must be continuous or with binary categorical features. Can contain missing values in NA format in the missing data setting.
2. **y** a continuous response of length n.
3. **n** Number of samples
4. **p** Number of covariates
5. **noise** Type of noise setting. There are two possibilities : *additive* or *missing*. In the *additive* setting it is necessary to specify the *tau* parameter, corresponding to the standard deviation of the additive error matrix. In the *missing* setting, nothing has to be specified.
6. **block** Chosen setting. Here, *block* should be equal to *TRUE*.

* BD-CoCoLasso setting
This method requires six inputs (let n be the number of observations, p the number of X variables, p1 the number of uncorrupted variables and p2 the number of corrupted variables, with p1 + p2 = p):
1. **X** n x p matrix of covariates. Can be high-dimensional, i.e., p >> n. Must be continuous or with binary categorical features. Can contain missing values in NA format in the missing data setting. The first p1 columns must correspond to the uncorrupted covariates, and the last p2 columns must correspond to the corrupted covariates. 
2. **y** a continuous response of length n.
3. **n** Number of samples
4. **p** Number of covariates
5. **p1** Number of uncorrupted covariates
6. **p2** Number of corrupted covariates
7. **noise** Type of noise setting. There are two possibilities : *additive* or *missing*. In the *additive* setting it is necessary to specify the *tau* parameter, corresponding to the standard deviation of the additive error matrix. In the *missing* setting, nothing has to be specified.
8. **block** Chosen setting. Here, *block* should be equal to *TRUE*.
